# Dynamic Arrays/vectors 
- implements the copy constructor
- implements the equals method
- sets an element to a given index, reset the size of the array as the user insert 
     data pass the maxLength
- Resizes the array if the user explicitly invoke the operation 
- Modifies the class so it can handle any kind of data type (generic data type class)
- Code is fully documented and the file is fully described with appropriate 
  information and algorithms
